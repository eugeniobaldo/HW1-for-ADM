## 
This repository deals with different types of exercises in hackerank site *https://www.hackerrank.com*
the exercises deal with topics regarding python language. among these topics: input and output functions, Lists, sets, operations, collections, regex, numpy.
###
these exercises are in the script.py file in the repository. there are either correct exercises, partially correct exercises and wrong exercises given different types of error, such as running_time and wrong visualization of output. the correctness of the exercises can be visualized in the screenshots present in the repository. Each exercise has a score related to its own difficulty. The score is determined, for each case, by the number of test cases used by hackerrank to judge the algorithm provided. However, even if many test cases are compiled correctly, the score may be zero. The difficulty of the exercises that I completed can be easy or medium.
